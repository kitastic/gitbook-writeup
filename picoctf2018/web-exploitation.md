When going to the page, there is a login prompt. I tried signing in as user "blah" and left the password empty. Then this page shows up.

In developer tools, go to Application tab, Cookies in sidebar and you will see the value of admin = false. Change it to True and refresh the page.

With username = admin, different passwords will work :  
`' or 1--`  The `--` at the end are to ensure every piece of SQL code after our injected code is interpreted by the database engine as a comment and thus ignored.  
`' or 'x'='x`   
Even this will work: username and password =  `1' or '1' = '1`

Logged in!
